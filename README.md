# Welcome

Before we start, it would be a crime not to mention [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
Neovim is a fork of the original Vim codebase that has done a lot of really great work modernizing and improving the tool with a bunch of great stuff like:

- Great API docs and improvements
- Remote plugins run as co-processes, safely and asynchronously
- GUIs, IDEs and web browsers can `--embed` Neovim as an editor or script host
- Strong defaults
- Modern terminal features such as cursor styles and focus events
- Fully compatible with Vim's editing model and the Vimscript language.

### Vim Distributions (preconfigured Vim plugins and settings)

Note: I don't recommend you start with these. They will give you some nice things out of the box,
but they obfuscate a lot of the configuration and when you're learning it's often better to do this stuff by hand
